Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: "Tell me about programming."

Improved Prompt
Clear and Specific Prompt: "Explain the key principles of object-oriented programming and provide examples of how they are used in Python."

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective
Specificity: The improved prompt specifies the focus on "object-oriented programming" rather than the broad topic of "programming." This helps in narrowing down the response to a specific area of interest.

Clarity: By mentioning "key principles," the prompt clearly defines what aspects of object-oriented programming should be covered, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Conciseness: The prompt is concise yet detailed enough to guide the response effectively, avoiding any ambiguity.

Context: Providing a context, such as the use of "examples in Python," ensures that the response will be practical and relevant to the user's needs.

Example Response to the Improved Prompt
Response: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. The key principles of OOP are:

Encapsulation: Encapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. For example:

python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Car make: {self.make}, Model: {self.model}")

my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
my_car.display_info()
Inheritance: Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, promoting code reuse. For example:

python
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

class Car(Vehicle):
    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Car make: {self.make}, Model: {self.model}")

my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
my_car.display_info()
Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, particularly through method overriding. For example:

python
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Bark"

class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Meow"

def make_sound(animal):
    print(animal.sound())

dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()
make_sound(dog)
make_sound(cat)
