2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
i) 1968, Birth of Software Engineering - The term software engineering was coined at the NATO Software Engineering Conference to address the software crisis—issues like high costs, project failures, and unreliable software.
ii) 1970, Waterfall Model Introduction - Winston Royce introduced the Waterfall Model, a structured approach to software development with sequential phases (e.g., Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment).
iii) 2001, Agile Manifesto - The Agile Manifesto emphasized flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development, leading to methodologies like Scrum and Kanban, improving efficiency and adaptability in software projects.


3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
i) Requirement Analysis – Gather and define system requirements based on business needs. (e.g., identifying features for an e-commerce website).
ii) Planning – Define project scope, timeline, budget, and resources. (e.g., selecting Agile or Waterfall methodology).
iii) Design – Create system architecture, UI/UX, and database models. (e.g., wireframes for a mobile app).
iv) Implementation (Coding) – Developers write and integrate code based on design specifications. (e.g., coding a login authentication system).
v) Testing – Identify and fix bugs, ensuring functionality, performance, and security. (e.g., unit testing and user acceptance testing).
vi) Deployment – Release the software for user access in a production environment. (e.g., launching a web application to the public).
vii) Maintenance – Provide updates, fix issues, and improve functionality as needed. (e.g., releasing security patches and new features).


4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
i) Approach - Waterfall follows a linear and sequential development process where each phase (requirements, design, coding, testing, deployment) must be completed before moving to the next.
            - Agile is iterative and flexible, allowing for incremental development with frequent revisions based on continuous feedback.
ii) Flexibility - Waterfall is rigid, meaning changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed. This makes it suitable for projects with well-defined requirements.
                - Agile is highly adaptable, enabling teams to make changes even late in the development cycle, which is beneficial for projects with evolving needs.
iii) Testing Process - Waterfall conducts testing only after development is completed, which may lead to late detection of issues.
                     - Agile integrates continuous testing throughout the development process, allowing for early bug detection and faster problem resolution.
iv) Client Involvement - Waterfall involves the client mainly at the beginning (requirement phase) and at the end (final delivery), limiting their influence on development progress.
                       - Agile encourages constant client interaction, ensuring the final product meets changing user needs.
v) Documentation - Waterfall relies on detailed documentation before development begins, making it beneficial for projects requiring strict compliance (e.g., regulatory or defense systems).
                 - Agile focuses on working software over documentation, prioritizing functional output over extensive paperwork.
Example scenarios
- Waterfall Example- Best for projects where requirements are fixed and changes are costly, such as government software, banking systems, or aerospace applications.
- Agile Example - Ideal for fast-changing industries like mobile app development, startup software products, or e-commerce platforms, where continuous updates and user feedback drive improvements.
